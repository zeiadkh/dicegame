## Tenzies game is a react app that I used 
+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ React.js
  
At this funny project, I have leveraged my grid skills in grid by creating real dice faces using grid in CSS,
Also, I have dealt with some external libraries like 'react-confetti', it was one of my first apps using react which I learned a lot during developing it.
